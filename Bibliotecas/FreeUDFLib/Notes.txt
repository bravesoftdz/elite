Important release notes:
------------------------

3/10/98

Because FreeUDFLib has been in release for over a year now, it is important
to recognize that many functions in the library should be removed in favor
of others.

With that in mind, we are following the following guidelines for obsoleting
functions:

1. When a function is marked as obsolete, it will be noted here, as well as
   in the project source file.
2. It will be given an obsolescence "index" of 1.
3. During each subsequent release, the obsolescence index of obsolete
   functions will be incremented.
4. When the obsolescence index reaches 4, it will be removed from the
   source distribution altogether (I reserve the right to let the index
   creep past 4 if I'm feeling lazy, but I guarantee that it will
   get at least to 4).
5. This means that the IB community has 4 releases to complain about
   a potentially bad decision I might make about obsoleting something!

Here is a list of obsolete functions and their associated obsolescence
indexes:

  UserMaintenance,                                      // Obsolete! (1)
     UserMaintenance is *not* a terribly useful function for adding and
     deleting users. It asks IB to start the gsec procedure on the server
     to add users, etc...
     Instead, the IBPassword function can be used with a direct connection
     to ISC4.GDB for adding, deleting and modifying users.
     (See encrypt.pas and chgpasswd.sql)
  FindFirstWord,                                        // Obsolete! (1)
  FindNextWord,                                         // Obsolete! (1)
     These two functions don't work properly with InterBase, as
     they would be used with the assumption that
          1 connection = 1 thread,
     but this is simply not the case.
     In a multi-user environment, FindFirstWord will always be correct, but
     FindNextWord could possibly return some wacky results.
  FindNthWord,                                          // Obsolete! (1)
     This function was made to accomodate the weirdnesses of the above
     two functions, but we've gotten better. Now, word-finding should be
     done using the two functions
       FindWord
       FindWordIndex
  Strip,                                                // Obsolete! (1)
     This function is a bit hard to understand! It certainly works at
     stripping unwanted characters, but it's very difficult to grasp
     the meaning of its declaration.
     A simpler, easier to follow function, called StripString is now
     the standard!
