You have just unzipped FreeUDFLib.zip!

It contains many useful UDFs for use with InterBase 4.2 and 5.0 under
the Win32 platforms (Sorry, no UNIX support with this).

It is written entirely in Delphi and all source code is provided.

As an added bonus, you also get a very complete Delphi port of
IB's ibase.h (ibase.pas) and a nice little extension (ib_external.pas)
that will eventually contain many "C"-like structures. Note that the ibase.pas
is written expressly for InterBase 5.0--compatibility with previous versions
is NOT guaranteed. For notes on ibase.pas, please see ib_conversion.txt.

Everything in this release is completely free! That's RIGHT, FREE!
It's not PUBLIC DOMAIN, though. Please see the license.txt file for
more information on licensing.

See FreeUDFLib.html for more docs.

Good luck!
